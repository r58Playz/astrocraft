This is the Python version of AstroCraft, a game like Minecraft.

Py3 support just started! Py2 has been dropped, as it reaches the end of its life on January 1, 2020.

A new formal website and download is going to be coming soon.


## Dependencies

The dependencies are `pyglet`, `typing`, and `cython`. `typing` is included just in case the Python API drops support for typehints.

Install them using `pip`:
```
pip install pyglet
pip install typing
pip install cython
```
* For Linux users: Install with `pip` **only** if the package manager does not support it. In some cases, you may not get support by them if installed with `pip`.

## Installation for Arch Linux

Use the PKGBUILD provided.
