# factories-python
This is based on ~bison--/Minecraft(https://github.com/bison--/Minecraft).

bison--/Minecraft is based on fogleman/Minecraft(https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft)

Only runs on Python 2.7.

There's a branch for Python 3(still in development).

# Dependencies
Here are the dependencies:
- Pyglet
- Tkinter
- psutil
- colorama(https://github.com/tartley/colorama)
- Git

Tkinter comes installed with Python, and there is no other way to install it. Git is needed for updating the game.

Here are the commands you need to run to install the dependencies:

```
pip install pyglet
pip install psutil
pip install colorama
```
# Running the game

To properly run the game, install Python 2.7 if you do not have it, install the dependencies(above), and run ```main.py```.

To use ```start.ps1```, you need to run the following commands before you can run it(we assume you have installed Python 2.7)

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv --python2.7
pipenv install pyglet
pipenv install psutil
pipenv install colorama
```

Then you can run ```start.ps1```.

This does the same thing as above, but does it in a virtualenv instead of on the computer.
