This is the Python version of AstroCraft, a game like Minecraft.

Py3 support just started! Py2 has been dropped, as it reaches the end of its life on January 1, 2020.


## Dependencies

The dependencies are `pyglet`, `typing`, and `cython`. `typing` is included just in case the Python API drops support for typehints.

Install them using `pip`:
```
pip install pyglet
pip install typing
pip install cython
```
