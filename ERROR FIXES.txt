Do not delete any of the python files. They are necessary for the game to function.
Some errors may occur when you first run it, these are explained below.

ERRORS:
1. Says something about format_for_chatlabel() in log.py:
    This is an error that occurs if the chat file isn't there, or if the chatfile isn't formatted correctly.
    This only occurs when the file isn't there.
    How to fix this:
        Make a new text file named "CHAT.FACTORIES" in the folder log.py, main.py, saveModule.py, and this file is in.
        Then open it and write:
            No chat...

        Please remember to make a newline after "No chat...". Otherwise, the game will not function correctly.
